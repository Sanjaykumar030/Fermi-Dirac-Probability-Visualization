# ⚛️ Fermi-Dirac Distribution Visualizer – Interactive GUI

A full-screen interactive Python GUI application that visualizes the **Fermi-Dirac distribution** and **energy band behavior** in semiconductors.  
Built with `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib.widgets`, this educational tool provides real-time visual feedback on how **temperature**, **semiconductor type**, and **energy levels** affect electron occupation probabilities.

## ✨ Features

🎨 Visualizes:
- **Valence Band**, **Conduction Band**, and **Fermi Level**
- **Energy state markers** with color-coded occupation probability
- **Temperature-dependent bandgap shifts**
- **Dynamic physical descriptions** (based on selected temperature, energy level, and semiconductor type)

🧩 Interactive Controls:
- **Temperature Slider**: 0 K to 1000 K
- **Semiconductor Type**: Intrinsic, n-type, p-type (via radio buttons)
- **Energy Level**: Below, equal to, or above Fermi level (via selector)

📊 Educational & User-Friendly Plot:
- Clean UI with labeled energy levels and bands
- Real-time updates on user input
- Designed for use in **Jupyter Notebook** with `%matplotlib widget` for full interactivity
