⚛️ Fermi-Dirac Distribution Visualizer – Interactive GUI
A full-screen interactive Python GUI application that visualizes Fermi-Dirac distribution and energy band behavior in semiconductors.
Built using matplotlib widgets and numpy, this educational tool helps explain how temperature, semiconductor type, and energy level affect electron occupation probability.

✨ Features
Visualizes:

Valence Band, Conduction Band, and Fermi Level

Energy state markers with color-mapped probability

Temperature-dependent bandgap shift

Dynamic description of physical concepts (based on selected temperature, semiconductor type, and energy level)

Interactive sliders and radio buttons:

Temperature: 0 K to 1000 K

Semiconductor type: Intrinsic, n-type, p-type

Energy level: Below, equal to, or above Fermi level

Clean and educational plot with real-time feedback

Fully functional with %matplotlib widget for interactive usage in Jupyter environments

💡 Inspiration
This project was born out of curiosity in semiconductor physics and the mathematical elegance of the Fermi-Dirac distribution.
It also serves as a follow-up project to my Differential Equation Solver, exploring symbolic and visual computing in physics and engineering.
